## What is JavaScript?

- JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, interpreted programming language.

- It is one of the core technologies of the web (along with HTML & CSS).

- Initially created to make web pages interactive (in 1995 by Brendan Eich).

- Today, JavaScript can run everywhere: browsers, servers (Node.js), mobile apps, desktop apps, even IoT.

---

## What is JavaScript used for?

1. Web Development (Frontend)

   - Make websites dynamic & interactive.

   - Example: form validation, animations, dropdown menus, slideshows.

   - Frameworks: React, Angular, Vue.

2. Backend Development

   - Using Node.js, JavaScript runs on servers.

   - Example: APIs, real-time apps (chat apps, gaming servers).

3. Mobile App Development

   - Frameworks like React Native, Ionic allow building cross-platform apps (Android + iOS) using JS.

4. Desktop Applications

   - With Electron.js, JavaScript can make apps like VS Code, Slack, Discord.

5. Game Development

   - Libraries like Phaser.js, Three.js help build browser-based 2D/3D games.

6. Machine Learning & AI

   - With TensorFlow.js, JS can run ML models directly in the browser.

## Explain Event Loop in JS

- JS is single-threaded (only one thing executes at a time).

- Event loop manages how synchronous code and asynchronous tasks (setTimeout, fetch, promises) run.

- Flow:

1. Call Stack executes synchronous code.

2. Asynchronous tasks (callbacks, promises) go to Task Queue or Microtask Queue.

3. Event Loop continuously checks if Call Stack is empty ‚Üí if yes, pushes queued tasks back into execution.

Example:

```js
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => console.log("Timeout"), 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("Promise"));

console.log("End");


Output:
Start
End
Promise   // microtasks run before macrotasks
Timeout
```
---


## What is Hoisting?

- Hoisting = JS behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope at compile phase.

- But only declarations are hoisted, not initializations.

Example:

```js
console.log(a);  // undefined
var a = 10;

foo();  // works, because function declarations are hoisted
function foo() {
  console.log("Hello");
}


But with let / const:

console.log(x); // ReferenceError (TDZ - Temporal Dead Zone)
let x = 5;
```
---
## Explain Promises

- A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.

- States:

1. Pending

2. Fulfilled

3. Rejected

Example:

```js
const fetchData = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => resolve("Data received"), 1000);
});

fetchData
  .then((res) => console.log(res))   // "Data received"
  .catch((err) => console.error(err))
  .finally(() => console.log("Done"));
```

‚úÖ Promises avoid ‚Äúcallback hell‚Äù and are the base for async/await.

----
## What is Currying?

- Currying = converting a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions that each take one argument.

- Useful for function reuse and partial application.

Example:

```js
// Normal function
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
console.log(add(2, 3)); // 5

// Curried function
function curryAdd(a) {
  return function (b) {
    return a + b;
  };
}
console.log(curryAdd(2)(3)); // 5
```

‚úÖ Interview short answer:

- Currying transforms a multi-argument function into nested single-argument functions, enabling partial application and reusability.

---

## What are Closures?

- A closure = when a function remembers the variables from its lexical scope, even after the outer function has finished executing.

Example:

```js
function outer() {
  let count = 0;
  return function inner() {
    count++;
    return count;
  };
}

const counter = outer();
console.log(counter()); // 1
console.log(counter()); // 2
```

Here, `inner` still has access to `count` from `outer`, even though `outer` is done.

‚úÖ Interview short answer:

- A closure is a function that remembers variables from its outer scope, even after that scope has closed.

---

## Explain Call, Apply, and Bind (with examples)

All three are used to control this context in JS.

```js
const person = {
  name: "Nandan",
  greet: function (city, country) {
    console.log(`Hi, I‚Äôm ${this.name} from ${city}, ${country}`);
  },
};

const another = { name: "John" };

// 1. call: invoke immediately, pass args one by one
person.greet.call(another, "Delhi", "India");
// Hi, I‚Äôm John from Delhi, India

// 2. apply: invoke immediately, pass args as array
person.greet.apply(another, ["New York", "USA"]);
// Hi, I‚Äôm John from New York, USA

// 3. bind: returns a new function with this bound
const boundFn = person.greet.bind(another, "London", "UK");
boundFn(); // Hi, I‚Äôm John from London, UK
```

‚úÖ Interview short answer:

- call ‚Üí calls function with a given this and args (separately).

- apply ‚Üí same as call, but args as an array.

- bind ‚Üí returns a new function with this bound, to be called later.

---

## What is Async/Await?

- async/await is syntactic sugar over Promises.

- Makes async code look synchronous and more readable.

- async ‚Üí always returns a promise.

- await ‚Üí pauses execution until the promise resolves/rejects.

Example:

```js
function fetchData() {
  return new Promise((resolve) =>
    setTimeout(() => resolve("Data received"), 1000)
  );
}

async function getData() {
  console.log("Start");
  const data = await fetchData();
  console.log(data); // "Data received"
  console.log("End");
}
getData();
```

‚úÖ Interview short answer:
Async/await is a cleaner way to handle promises in JS. await pauses execution until the promise settles.

---

## `this` in Normal Functions

- The value of this depends on how the function is called, not where it‚Äôs defined.

- Cases:

  1. In global scope (non-strict mode):

```js
console.log(this); // window (in browsers), global object (in Node)
```

2. Inside a normal function (non-strict mode):

```js
function normalFunc() {
  console.log(this);
}
normalFunc(); // window (in browsers)
```

3. Inside a normal function (strict mode):

```js
"use strict";
function normalFunc() {
console.log(this);
}
normalFunc(); // undefined
```

4. As a method inside an object:

```js
const obj = {
name: "Nandan",
greet: function() {
console.log(this.name);
}
};
obj.greet(); // "Nandan" (this = obj)
```

5. Method extracted:

```js
const greetFn = obj.greet;
greetFn(); // undefined (strict) or window (non-strict)
```

üëâ Summary: In normal functions, this is dynamic and depends on how the function is called.

---

## `this` in Arrow Functions

- Arrow functions do not have their own this.

- Instead, they lexically inherit this from the surrounding scope (the place where they are defined).

Example:

```js

const obj = {
  name: "Nandan",
  greet: () => {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
};
obj.greet(); // undefined (arrow doesn't bind `this`, so `this` refers to global/window)

```

But if defined inside a method:

```js
const obj = {
  name: "Nandan",
  greet: function() {
    const arrowFn = () => {
      console.log(this.name);
    };
    arrowFn();
  }
};
obj.greet(); // "Nandan" (arrow function inherits `this` from greet‚Äôs scope)
```

üëâ Summary:

- Normal function: this is determined at call-time.

- Arrow function: this is determined at definition-time (lexical scope).

üîπ Example Comparison

```js
const user = {
  name: "Nandan",
  normalFn: function() {
    console.log("Normal:", this.name);
  },
  arrowFn: () => {
    console.log("Arrow:", this.name);
  }
};

user.normalFn(); // Normal: Nandan
user.arrowFn();  // Arrow: undefined
```

‚úÖ Quick Mnemonic:

- Normal function ‚Üí this depends on how you call it.

- Arrow function ‚Üí this depends on where you write it.

## Shallow Copy vs Deep Copy

### 1. Shallow Copy

- Copies the first-level properties of an object/array.

- If the property is a primitive value (string, number, boolean, etc.), it gets copied by value.

- If the property is a reference type (object, array, function), only the reference (memory address) is copied, not the actual nested object.

- ‚ùå Changes in nested objects affect both copies.

Example:

```js
const original = { name: "Nandan", address: { city: "Delhi" } };

// Shallow copy using spread
const shallowCopy = { ...original };

shallowCopy.name = "John";
shallowCopy.address.city = "Mumbai";

console.log(original.name);      // "Nandan" ‚úÖ not affected
console.log(original.address.city); // "Mumbai" ‚ùå affected (shared reference)
```

### 2. Deep Copy

- Creates a true copy of the object, including all nested objects/arrays.

- No references are shared ‚Äî completely independent objects.

- ‚úÖ Changes in one object do not affect the other.

Example (using JSON):

```js
const original = { name: "Nandan", address: { city: "Delhi" } };

// Deep copy
const deepCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(original));

deepCopy.name = "John";
deepCopy.address.city = "Mumbai";

console.log(original.name);      // "Nandan" ‚úÖ not affected
console.log(original.address.city); // "Delhi" ‚úÖ not affected
```

üîπ Key Differences

| Aspect          | Shallow Copy                                                   | Deep Copy                                                        |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**  | Copies only first-level values, nested objects share reference | Creates a full independent clone (nested included)               |
| **Nested Objects** | Shared between copies                                        | Duplicated independently                                         |
| **Performance** | Faster (less work)                                             | Slower (more memory & processing)                                |
| **Use Cases**   | When object is flat/simple                                     | When object has nested objects/arrays and independence is needed |

üîπ Ways to Create

- Shallow Copy:

  - Spread operator ({...obj})

  - Object.assign({}, obj)

  - Array.slice(), Array.concat()

- Deep Copy:

  - JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj) (‚ö†Ô∏è loses methods, undefined, Date, etc.)

  - Libraries like Lodash (\_.cloneDeep(obj))

  - Custom recursive function

‚úÖ Interview Short Answer:

- Shallow copy copies only one level, nested objects are shared references.

- Deep copy duplicates everything, including nested objects, making them independent.
