## Difference between Real DOM and Virtual DOM
- Real DOM (Document Object Model):
    - Actual representation of the HTML structure in the browser.
    - Directly reflects changes in UI.
    - Slow for frequent updates â†’ every DOM change causes reflow & repaint.
    - Example:
      `` document.getElementById("btn").innerText = "Clicked!"; 
      ``


- Virtual DOM:
    - A lightweight, in-memory JS object copy of the Real DOM (used in React, Vue).

    - When state changes â†’ React updates the Virtual DOM first â†’ compares old vs new (diffing) â†’ updates only the changed parts in the Real DOM.
    - Faster, more efficient.
- âœ… Key difference:
    - Real DOM updates the whole tree,
    - Virtual DOM updates only whatâ€™s changed.

## Explain Component Lifecycle (React)

React components go through 3 main phases:
- Mounting â†’ Component is created & inserted into DOM.

    - Methods/Hooks: constructor, render, componentDidMount / useEffect(() => {}, []).
- Updating â†’ Component re-renders when props or state change.

    - Methods/Hooks: shouldComponentUpdate, render, componentDidUpdate / useEffect(() => {...}, [state]).
- Unmounting â†’ Component is removed from DOM.

    - Methods/Hooks: componentWillUnmount / cleanup in useEffect.

Example with hooks:
```
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Mounted");

  return () => {
    console.log("Unmounted");
  };
}, []);
```

##  What is React Reconciliation?


- Reconciliation = the process React uses to update the DOM efficiently when a componentâ€™s state/props change.

- React uses the Virtual DOM:

    - Builds a new virtual tree after a state/prop change.

    - Compares old vs new (diffing).

    - Applies the minimum required updates to the Real DOM.

- Example:
```
function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{count}</h1> {/* only this updates, not entire DOM */}
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>+</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

âœ… Interview short answer:
- Reconciliation is how React compares the new Virtual DOM with the old one and updates only the changed parts in the Real DOM for performance.


## React vs Next.js (Which to prefer?)

- React â†’ library for building UI. Needs additional setup for routing, SSR, SEO, etc.

- Next.js â†’ framework built on top of React, with features like:

    - File-based routing (no need for React Router).

    - Server-side rendering (SSR) & Static Site Generation (SSG).

    - API routes built-in.

    - Better SEO.

ðŸ‘‰ If you want just a frontend UI, React is fine.

ðŸ‘‰ If you want production-ready apps with SSR, SEO, routing, APIs, Next.js is preferred.

## Virtual DOM in React & which DOM comes first in npm run dev?

- Virtual DOM (VDOM): a lightweight copy of the Real DOM kept in memory.

- When state/props change, React updates the VDOM first, then uses diffing + reconciliation to update only the changed parts in the Real DOM.

ðŸ‘‰ When you run npm run dev:

- React first builds the Virtual DOM in memory.

- Then updates the Real DOM based on differences.
So Virtual DOM is created first.

## Routing in React

React itself doesnâ€™t have routing â†’ we use React Router.

- BrowserRouter â†’ uses HTML5 history API.

- Routes & Route â†’ define components per path.

- Link â†’ navigation without reload.

Example:
```
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, Link } from "react-router-dom";

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <nav>
        <Link to="/">Home</Link> | <Link to="/about">About</Link>
      </nav>

      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}
```
